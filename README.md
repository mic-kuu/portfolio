# Project2: mic-kuu's portfolio
This project is a result of Udcaity's Fullstack Developer Nanodegree assginment. It's a simple draft of my personal portfolio - designed according to current HTML5 and CSS3 standards.

## Overview
The portfolio project has a very simple structure. It's core is the index.html file placed in the root directory of this repository. All supplementary files are placed in the subdirectories (/img - images, /js - java script files, /css - css files). 
The site uses the css flexbox to achieve a responsive effect. The site uses the [miligram](http://milligram.io/) - a lightweight and responsive css framework. 

## How to use 
Simply run the index.html file in your web browser
